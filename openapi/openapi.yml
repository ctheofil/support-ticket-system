  title: Support Ticket System API
  description: |
    A Spring Boot backend microservice for submitting and managing support tickets. 
    This system allows users to create support tickets and enables agents to respond 
    and update ticket statuses through a RESTful API.

    ## Features
    - Create and manage support tickets
    - Status transition management with validation
    - Public and internal comment system
    - Filtering and querying capabilities
    - Thread-safe in-memory storage
    - Comprehensive error handling

    ## Business Rules
    ### Status Transitions
    - `OPEN` → `IN_PROGRESS` (agent picks up ticket)
    - `IN_PROGRESS` → `RESOLVED` (issue resolved)
    - `RESOLVED` → `CLOSED` (user confirms or auto-close)
    - `Any Status` → `CLOSED` (administrative closure)
    - **Restriction**: Closed tickets cannot be reopened

    ### Comment System
    - **Public Comments**: Visible to both users and agents
    - **Internal Comments**: Visible only to support staff
    - **User Restrictions**: Users (authorId starting with "user-") can only post public comments
    - **Audit Trail**: All comments are timestamped and attributed
    - **Immutability**: Comments cannot be modified once created

    ### Filtering Rules
    - When `userId` is specified: Customer request → Only public comments visible
    - When `assigneeId` is specified: Agent request → All comments visible
    - When neither specified: All comments visible (general listing)

    ## Error Handling
    All error responses follow a consistent format with two fields:
    - `code`: Technical error code (e.g., "VALIDATION_ERROR", "RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND")
    - `message`: Human-readable error description
    
    Common error scenarios:
    - **400 Bad Request**: Validation errors, invalid enum values, user permission violations
    - **404 Not Found**: Ticket not found
    - **500 Internal Server Error**: Business rule violations (e.g., updating closed tickets)

      description: |
        Updates the status of a ticket through the ticket lifecycle. Status transitions 
        are validated according to business rules.

        **Valid Status Transitions:**
        - `OPEN` → `IN_PROGRESS` (agent picks up ticket)
        - `IN_PROGRESS` → `RESOLVED` (issue resolved)  
        - `RESOLVED` → `CLOSED` (user confirms or auto-close)
        - `Any Status` → `CLOSED` (administrative closure)

        **Business Rules:**
        - Closed tickets cannot have their status updated
        - Status must be a valid TicketStatus enum value
        - Status transitions are enforced to prevent invalid state changes
